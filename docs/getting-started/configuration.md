# Configuration

## Adding a host

After the installation is complete, you will need to create a host: `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Arthas UI`.

- Open `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Arthas UI` and click on the `+` sign in the `Host Machines` list to create a host:

Clicking on this will bring up another configuration dialog:

:::tip

You can theoretically use any version of Arthas and Jdk, just make sure they are compatible!

:::

- `Connect Config`: determines how you connect to the corresponding host.
- `Provider Config`: determines where on the host you search for the JVM.

These two configs have a `1:n` relationship, i.e. one `Connect Config` can correspond to multiple `Provider Config`!
