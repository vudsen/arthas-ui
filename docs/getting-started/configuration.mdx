# Configuration

:::warning

As the plugin is updated, some of the images may not match the latest version, but the documentation ensures that the process is the same throughout.

:::

## Add A Host Machine

After the installation is complete, you need to create a host machine:

- Open `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Arthas UI` and click on the `+` sign in the `Host Machines` list to create a host:

![create-hostmachine](/img/intro/create-hostmachine.png)

Clicking on this will bring up another configuration dialog:

![hostmachine-config](/img/intro/new-host-machine-step1.png)

- `Name`: Name of the host.
- `Connect type`: connection type, currently supports local and SSH connections.

:::danger

When `Connect type` is SSH, **only Linux is supported**, Windows and macOS is not supported!

:::

When the configuration is complete, and click the Next, the plugin will do a simple probe and search the toolchain available on the host machine:

![toolchain-config](/img/intro/toolchain-config.png)

- `Data directory`: the data directory, we will automatically download `arthas` and `jattach` to this directory,
you don't need to prepare it in advance. The default directory is `/opt/arthas-ui`.

In the Tab panel of the image, it determines where the plugin searches the JVM:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Local" default>
  Search for the host's local JVM

  - `Java home`: Java directory, supports jre.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Docker">
  Search for JVMs in Docker containers

  - `Java home`: Java directory in the container, supports jre, can be empty.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After filling in all the necessary parameters, click `Create` in the bottom right corner to create the host.
