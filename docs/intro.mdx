# Introduction

Arthas-UI is an IDEA plugin that allows you to Attach to the JVM and execute commands directly from IDEA.

Features.

- ðŸ“–: Support for custom Ognl scripts to filter the JVM, no longer need to find the PID yourself!
- ðŸ“¦: Automatically copy Jdk and Arthas to containers.
- ðŸ–Š: The result of each command will be recorded separately, support clear screen, view history
- ðŸ”Ž: Support auto-completion and syntax checking of Arthas commands ( *unstable, still working on it* )
- ðŸ’¡: support clicking Arthas output to jump to the corresponding code.

## Quick start

### Installation

<iframe width="245px" height="48px" src="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/embeddable/install/26846"></iframe>

### Setup

First you need to create a host: `Settings

- Open `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Arthas UI` and create a host by clicking the `+` sign in the `Host Machines` list:

![create-hostmachine](/img/intro/create-hostmachine.png)

Clicking on this will bring up another configuration dialog:

![hostmachine-config](/img/intro/hostmachine-config.png)

Here, we select, `Connect type` as `Local` and turn on the `Local` option in `Provider Config`, then provide the relevant path parameters.

---

Two important properties in a host: `Connect Config` and `Provider Config`, they have a `1:n` relationship, i.e. one `Connect Config` can correspond to more than one `Provider Config`.

- `Connect Config`: determines how you connect to the corresponding host.
- `Provider Config`: determines where on the host you search for JVMs.

:::tip

You can theoretically use any version of Arthas and Jdk, just make sure they are compatible with each other!

:::

### Connecting to the JVM

Once added, click on the `Arhtas` icon on the right side of the toolbar to expand our core component:

![toolwindow](/img/intro/toolwindow.png)

**Double-click** on the `Local JVM` or **click on any node and then click on the Refresh button in the upper toolbar** to list all the current local JVMs.
Let's use the official Arthas `math-game.jar` as an example. In Arthas Home, run `math-game` with `java -jar math-game.jar`.

After launching `math-game`, click the Refresh button to refresh all the JVMs, and then find `math-game.jar` (`6608 in the image above . \math-game.jar`), double-click it.

### Execute the command

After double-clicking, a file will open where you can directly type in Arthas's commands: !

![queryconsole](/img/intro/query_console.png)

A couple of things are worth noting:

- Every command needs to end in `;`.
- We provide syntax checking so that if there is a problem with a command, the IDE will give you an error.
- Even if the IDE gives you an error, you can still execute the command. We don't have any restrictions on the actual execution, even if the command is indeed wrong!

:::note

Why semicolon endings?

1. to make the separation between commands more obvious
2. it's simple to implement and doesn't require complex syntax parsing
3. to avoid ambiguity: for example, the `sm` command can optionally provide a method name, so for the command `sm MyClass echo -d`, what is it?
Is it a `sm` command or a `sm` command plus a `echo` command?

:::

**Select the command you want to execute and click the green button Run button in the upper left corner to execute it**. After clicking on it, it will start to create a connection and Attach to the JVM to execute your command.

When you select a command and want to execute it, we will get the string you selected and then.

1. remove the spaces to the left and right of the command
2. replace all newlines with spaces
3. remove the semicolon at the end of the command (if any)
4. execute the command

**That means you can split a command into multiple lines and then execute it.**

After the command is run, a terminal will be opened, showing the result of the run: !

![run](/img/intro/run.png)

#### Executing Listener Commands

Listening commands, i.e. commands that do not exit immediately after execution, such as `watch`, `stack`, etc., which never exit voluntarily without specifying `-n`.

:::tip

You cannot execute the next command until the previous command has finished executing.

:::

To exit such commands, you need to manually stop them by clicking on the progress bar in the bottom-right corner:

![stop](/img/intro/stop.png)

### Exit

The Arthas process can be shut down by clicking the stop button on the toolbar or in the terminal.
